Create a zoo project that contains the following classes:
        Animal
        |     |
   Reptile    Mammal
   |     |      |       |
Lizard  Snake   Gorilla Bear

Follow the diagram and create all the classes. Except for the Animal class, each class should inherit from another class, as shown in the diagram. The Animal class should receive a name - string upon initialization.
Every class should have a constructor, which accepts one parameter: name
Test Code
mammal = Mammal("Stella")
print(mammal.__class__.__bases__[0].__name__)
print(mammal.name)
lizard = Lizard("John")
print(lizard.__class__.__bases__[0].__name__)
print(lizard.name)
Output
Animal
Stella
Reptile
John
